Basic Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental data structures, including Arrays, Matrices, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, and Rooted Trees. These implementations are designed to demonstrate the basic operations and performance characteristics of each data structure.

How to Run

Step 1: Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/jakejeffers/MSCE-532-Assignment-6.git

cd MSCS-532-Assignment-6

Step 2: Run each individual script.

python ArrayTest.py

python MatrixTest.py

python StackTest.py

python QueueTest.py

python LinkedList.py

Each script contains test cases that showcase insertion, deletion, transversal, etc.

Summary of Findings

Arrays offer O(1) time complexity for access operations but O(n) for insertion and deletion, making them ideal for static datasets. Matrices are useful for multidimensional data manipulation, with operations like row deletion requiring O(n). Stacks and Queues demonstrate efficient O(1) operations for push/pop and enqueue/dequeue. Linked Lists provide efficient insertion and deletion, especially when the position is known, but traversal is O(n).
